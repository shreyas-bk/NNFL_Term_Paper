# NNFL_Term_Paper - [CYCLEGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593)

Implementation Details:
 - Model trained on subset of Van Gogh dataset (400 images of both categories)
 - Model trained for 200 epochs
 - Architecture similar to diagram given below, but with 9 residual blocks since input image size is 256x256

Generator Architecture:

The contents of the assignment are as follows:
```
13
|   NNFL_Paper13.ppt               - contain the powerpoint presentation for this term paper  
|   NNFL_Assignment_CycleGAN.ipynb - contains the code that is used to create, train and test or implementation
|				     of CycleGAN. All details about the explaination of functions and files, 
|				     and instructions to execute the code is present within the tex cells of the
|				     notebook.
|___Base Code                      - contains original base code for the implementation of CycleGAN (contents of 
|         			     each file and function are given at the start of the notebook)

|   train_plot.png        	   - contains the plot of the traning losses when we trained CycleGAN on VanGogh 
|			             dataset for 200 epochs
|   loss_log.txt                   - contaians the numeric values of all the different losses throughout the 
|				     training process of 200 epochs 
|   train_opt.txt                  - contains the details of the configurations we used to train the model
```
Note: The notebook itself is sufficient to train the model
